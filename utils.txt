PHOST UTILITIES
================

  These are the PHost Utilities.
     CRACK       - decode player passwords
     KILLRACE    - remove a race from the game
     PALLY       - set up alliances
     PTSCORE     - famous scoring system
  This version of the utilities should work well with PHost 3.x as
  well as 4.x.

  Note that PMASTER has deliberately not been included, you should use
  AMASTER instead. If you insist on PMASTER, you can use one of the
  older versions which should work as well.


Quickie docs for the utilities
===============================

  Here's a quick introduction to the utilities. PTSCORE has its own
  documentation file.

  All utilities have the basic syntax:
     utility [options...] <gamedirectory> [<rootdirectory>]
  All utilities (PTSCORE excluded) accept the options '-h' (display
  help message) and '-v' (display version number).


CRACK
------

  usage: crack <gamedirectory>

  This will print out all player passwords.


KILLRACE
---------

  usage: killrace [-k] <race> <gamedirectory>

  This will remove the specified race (1..11) from the specified game,
  after a prompt. If '-k' is specified, skips the prompt.


PALLY
------

  usage: pally [-t <nnn>|-c <nnn>] <gamedirectory>

  Without options, displays current alliances.

  With option '-t', builds a full alliance between all players given in
  <nnn> (e.g., '-t 12A' makes an alliance between Fed, Lizard and Rebel).

  With option '-c', cancels all alliances involving races from <nnn>
  (e.g., '-c 12A' cancels all alliances involving Feds, Lizards or Rebels).


SENDMESS
---------

  usage: sendmess [-a] [-f <name>] <races> <gamedirectory>

  Reads a message text from standard input, and sends it to all races
  specified on the command line. <races> must be a sequences of digits
  or letters not separated by spaces, e.g. '37B' for Bird, Crystals and
  Colonies. 'E' sends to everyone in the game.

  With option '-a', abort the message when it exceeds size limits (15x40).
  By default SENDMESS truncates the message.

  You can change your name with '-f'. By default, messages appear as
  'FROM: Your Host'. With '-f "Fred vom Jupiter"', they will appear as
  'FROM: Fred vom Jupiter'.
