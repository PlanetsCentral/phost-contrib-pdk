	* enum.c: dynamically resize enumPointer. Renamed it to
	newEnumPointer to have the compiler find places that were not
	updated. The old version bombed when querying for more than
	500 minefields. mscxtra.c contains these, too, but since
	`MICROSQUISH' is never defined, we can probably dump these
	anyway.

	* pconfig.c (Read_THost_HConfig_File): when assigning PConfig
 	entries, use pconfig type, not hconfig. This explains the problem
 	from 25/Jul/2001.

	* auxdata.c (ReadCLOAKCFile): do not complain when cloakc.hst
	is missing

	* tconfig.hi: types were wrong for two HCONFIG.HST entries
	(why didn't it complain!?)

Sat Jul 21 17:07:16 2001  Stefan  <Streu@gmx.de>

	* pconfig.c (Read_THost_HConfig_File): new function
	gCurrentConfigFile: new variable. Used throughout the code.

	* phostpdk.h: added #defines to use pconfig.src names in 
	source code (from Piotr Winiarczyk)
	included new config options
	restored single-read routine prototypes (seem to have got
	lost in PDK v3.x)

Mon Apr 16 23:13:06 2001  Stefan  <Streu@gmx.de>

	* pconfig.c (Read_HConfig_File): use new ConfigFileReaderEx, 
	giving warnings instead of errors
	(DoAssignment): give warnings instead of errors

	* config.hi: new version from PHost 3.3 (new options)

	* pconfig.c (ConfigFileReaderEx): ConfigFileReader with two
	new arguments to allow reading of config files *with* continuing
	after error
	(checkValue): use new config.hi format from PHost 3.3

	* phostpdk.h: IO_Def now typdef'd here (was #defined to
	Boolean in private.h before). Allows better prototype for
	ConfigFileReader &c.

	* ex7.c, ex7.sh: new example for PutUtilFileTransfer API

	* phostpdk.h: prototypes for utildata stuff

	* utildata.c: new file (approx. the same as before, but with
	other doscvt functions).

	* doscvt.c (DOS16Convert, DOS32Convert, DOSStructConvert,
	UnixConvertStruct, DOSStructSize): copied from PHost source and
	reindented

	* Makefile: attempt to reduce the mess of makefiles we currently
 	have: all the main rules in `common.mak', configuration in
 	`Makefile'. First design study only ;-)

	* crack.c (main): ReadGlobalData, else it will fail parsing
 	hullfunc files.

	* vgaputil.c (MemRealloc): if pPtr is NULL, behave like
 	MemAlloc. This is what ANSI C does for malloc/realloc, and I think
 	it's very convenient.
	
	* conf.h (#ifdef __DJGPP__): #undef __MSDOS__. IMHO this is better
 	done here than in the makefile. Simply because I don't have a
 	`make' which understands `makefile.dj' on my DOS partition ;-)
	(#ifndef SYSTEM_ID): #error

NOTES:
	* The doscvt stuff should be added to the API, so users can write
	portable files. I think it's best to simply ship the `doscvt.h'
	header as an extra entry point to the PDK.  

	* The Makefile mess should be cleaned. At least, extract the
 	source file name list and include it into the others. Document
 	which Makefile is for which system.
