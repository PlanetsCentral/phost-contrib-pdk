                     THE PORTABLE HOST DEVELOPMENT KIT
                            Summary of Revisions
                              Version 3.2.4.3


Version 3.2.4.3
================

* Added ability to modify static game data (Piotr Winiarczyk)

Version 3.2.4.2 --  Released September 2001
====================

* Added ability to read HCONFIG.HST
* Updated for latest PHost config options (3.3c)
  - The PDK is now able to read config options of PHOSTs newer then the
    PDK. The new options will silently be ignored.

Version 3.2.4.1 --  Released December 17, 2000
====================

* Support for more than 500 minefields added
* Fixed bug where cloak status was determined only from the mission of a ship
  if PHOST 3.2.3.X was used
* Added support for setting cloak status
* Added access to combat shield settings (for auxbc programs)



Version 3.2.3.3 BETA -- Released April 2, 2000
====================

* Access to the player activity level added
* Bug fixed: ReadGlobalData() and ReadHostData will return False if the
  initialization was unsuccessful (instead of calling ErrorExit())



Version 3.2.3.2 -- Released March 5, 1998
===============

                              ***** NOTE *****

        The current version of the PHOST 3 PDK is ONLY compatible with
        PHOST 3, not with PHOST v2.x and not with HOST. Please ignore all
        references to this compatibility in the documentation. This level
        of compatibility is a goal for the future.

* Support added for the changes in config options introduced in PHOST
  3.2.3.2. Specifically, support was added for the new AntiCloakImmunity
  config option and the new allowable ranges for the SBQPointsForAging,
  PALCombatPlanetScaling, and PALCombatBaseScaling options.


Version 3.2.3.1 BETA --  Released January 8, 1998
====================

* PHOSTPDK.H: Pconfig_Struct redefined to new PHOST 3 options. Note that
              many options, formerly scalars, are now arrays. Thus, you must
              change references of the form gConfigInfo->TerraformRate
              to gConfigInfo->TerraformRate[Player], for example.

* Ship Build Queue API: Functions now work with new BaseOrder_Struct
  structure (defined in PHOSTPDK.H) rather than BuildOrder_Struct. This
  gives access to cloning information and priority points. The functions
  affected are:
       BuildQueuePeek
       BuildQueuePush

* A new function SortBuildQueue() sorts the build queue by priority.

* New set of API functions for remote control:
       BeginShipRemoteControl
       EndShipRemoteControl
       IsShipRemoteControlled
       IsShipRemoteForbidden
       ResetShipRemoteControl
       AllowShipRemoteControl
       ForbidShipRemoteControl
       ShipRemoteController
       ShipRemoteOwner

* Config file (PCONFIG.SRC) is now read directly when ReadHostData() is
  called. The PCONFIG.SRC file *must* be present. Reading of HCONFIG.HST
  (THost config) or PHOST v2.x PCONFIG.SRC/PCONFIG.HST files not supported
  yet.

* A new function ConfigFileReader() allows easy parsing of config files
  with the same format as PCONFIG.SRC.

* Changed HullDoes... functions to ShipDoes... functions to account for
  new HULLFUNC.TXT interface. For example, HullDoesAlchemy() is obsolete,
  ShipDoesAlchemy() is the replacement.

                            ***** NOTE *****

  The HullDoesXXX() functions took a hull number argument, like this:

           HullDoesAlchemy(ShipHull(ShipID))

  The ShipDoesXXX() functions take a ship number argument, like this:

           ShipDoesAlchemy(ShipID)

* The Read_XXXX_File functions have disappeared as people were having too
  many problems with the dependencies between files (for example, many
  functions returned nonsensical results when the Read_HConfig_File() wasn't
  called first). There are now only two functions for reading the data
  files, ReadHostData() (for game specific data) and ReadGlobalData() (for
  ship list data, etc.)

* New wraparound map API:
    WrapMapX
    WrapMapY
    WrapDistX
    WrapDistY
    IsPointOnWrapMap
    DistanceSquared
    Distance
    IsDistanceLTRadius
    RewrapShipsAndMines

* Added support for Russian language and Estonian language messages.

* FIXED BUG: The starbase-handling module was not initialized if a universe
  containing no starbases was encountered. Trying to write the bases file
  gave an error saying that this file could not be written prior to reading
  it.


Version 3.2.2.7  --  Released March 30, 1996
===============

* Added new API functions (see API.DOC for descriptions):
        IsAllyOfferConditional
        IsAllyOfferAny
        PutMinefieldOwner
        Combat

* Added support for new HOST 3.22 RST file formats. Programs that use the
  WriteMessageToRST() function should be recompiled with this version of
  the PDK in order to be compatible with HOST 3.22 and PHOST v2.12.

* Added a combat module to the PDK. The addition of the Combat() API
  routine allows external programs to perform PHOST combat in exactly the
  same fashion as PHOST. See the "Combat Interface" section of API.DOC for
  more details. (NOT AVAILABLE IN MICROSOFT-DOS DISTRIBUTION)

* Another example program, EX6.C, was included to demonstrate an interface
  to the new Combat() API routine.

* Clarified the 'Alliance Management' section of the API.DOC file. Please
  re-read the description of the functions in this section to get a better
  idea of what's going on with the alliance interface.

* Forgot to include the example files (EX*.C files) in the non-DOS
  distributions.

* The warning saying that wormholes are enabled but no wormhole.txt file
  exists is now disabled if gNonPHOSTWarnings is False.

* Added support for Dutch language messages.

* Added support for all new PHOST config options since the last release.


Version 3.2.2.6  --  Released January 6, 1996
===============

* The structure of the PDK library was segregated so that unnecessary
  modules will no longer be linked in. Thus, programs linked with the PDK
  library will generally be smaller than before (unless, of course, they
  use all PDK modules). For example, if your program has nothing to do with
  starbases and doesn't call any starbase read/write/accessor functions,
  then the starbase module of the PDK won't be linked in and your program
  will be smaller.

* Added the following API functions (see API.DOC):
          IsShipCloaked

* Removed the following routines from the API (no longer necessary):
          ExternalMessageCleanup
          AUXHOSTMessageCleanup

  Please remove all calls to these functions from your programs.

* New global variable gNonPHOSTWarnings was added. Please see API.DOC for a
  description of this variable.

* BUG: A call to ReadWormholeFile() was required before any of the wormhole
  accessors (including CreateWormhole()) would function correctly.

* BUG: Forgot to include prototypes for GameFilesVersion() and MemRealloc()
  in the phostpdk.h file.

* Support for Spanish and Italian language messages was added.

* Support for the following config options was added:
          PlayerRace
          ProductionRate
          MineOddsWarpBonusX10
          CloakMineOddsWarpBonusX10
          WebMineOddsWarpBonusX10
          MineTravelSafeWarp
          CloakedMineTravelSafeWarp
          WebMineTravelSafeWarp

* Removed the warning message saying that some configuration options will
  be ignored (due to the player files version being more recent than the
  program version).


Version 3.2.2.5  --  Released October 22, 1995
===============

* The PDK did not keep up with changes in the AUXDATA.HST file format
  through the latest PHOST 3.2 versions. PDK version 3.2.2.5 should be used
  to recompile all custom applications that use it.

* The interpretation of which mines were web mines and which were normal
  could be incorrect for HOST 3.2 games using the Starbase+ add-on.

* Support for French language messages was added.

* Support for the CumulativePillaging, AllowInterceptAttack, and
  RaceGrowthRate, config options was added.

* New API routines added (see API.DOC for descriptions):
      GameFilesVersion()
      MemRealloc()
      pgetopt() (along with global variables 'poptind' and 'poptarg')


Version 3.2.2.4  --  Released July 22, 1995
===============

* Planet and native happiness levels could fall below the minimum of -300.
  
* AUXDATA.HST files must now be generated by PHOST v2.5 or higher for the
  PDK to read them (unless they are generated by PHOST v1.x).

* Support added for conditional alliances implemented in PHOST v2.5. The
  PutPlayerAllowsAlly() function has changed its definition slightly (see
  API.DOC). Any code that uses this function should be changed.

* PHOST will no longer complain if the BDATA.HST file is 2 bytes too short,
  as it may be after editing with external utilities such as PLANMAP.


Version 3.2.2.3  --  Released June 28, 1995
===============

* Write_AuxData_File() had a bug that would cause the AUXDATA.HST file to
  be incorrectly written.

* WriteAUXHOSTMessage() contained a memory leak that would cause allocated
  memory to not be released, resulting in a growing memory demand.

* A new routine has been added, PutPlayerPassword(), which sets the
  password for a player.

* Renamed PutPlanetNativeType() to PutPlanetNatType() to be symmetrical
  with the existing PlanetNatType() routine. A #define statement in
  phostpdk.h defines PutPlanetNativeType to PutPlanetNatType for backward
  compatibility.


Version 3.2.2.2  --  Released June 15, 1995
===============

* The Write_Auxdata_File() function would write the version number of the
  PDK, not the version number that already existed in the file when it was
  read in.

* HullDoes...() functions added for new 3.2 features. New functions are:

               HullDoesAdvancedRefinery
               HullIsGamblingShip
               HullIsAntiCloaking
               HullDoesImperialAssault
               HullDoesChunneling
               HullHasRamScoop
               HullDoesBioscan
               HullHasGloryDevice

* Modified the description of alliance functions in API.DOC to say that
  alliance functions can be called even if no AUXDATA.HST file has been
  read. In this case, no changes to alliance status will be saved (the
  AUXDATA.HST file will not be written out if it has not been read) and all
  status functions will return False.

* The WriteHostData() function no longer calls Write_Racenames_File().


Version 3.2.2.1  --  Released May 30, 1995
===============

* No AUXDATA.HST file is written now if the file was not read in.

* Initialize...() functions added

* New example programs EX3.C, EX4.C, and EX5.C added.


Version 3.2.2.0  --  Released May 21, 1995
===============

* First limited public release
