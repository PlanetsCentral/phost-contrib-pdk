                     THE PORTABLE HOST DEVELOPMENT KIT
                             Version 3.2.4.1

What is the Portable Host Development Kit ?
===========================================

The Portable Host Development Kit (or PDK) is a development tool for use by
programmers of VGA Planets host add-ons and utilities. VGA Planets is a
play-by-email game for the IBM PC written by Tim Wisseman. The PDK
liberates programmers from having to worry about file formats and data
structures and provides a simple programming interface in their place.
Programmers can concentrate on writing innovative utilities and add-ons
without having to reinvent the wheel as far as basic input, output, and
data structure accesses are concerned.

Using the PDK to write a host utility or add-on has several advantages:

      * There's no need to know or understand the host file formats and
        data structures. All access to host data is through a simple
        programming interface.

      * There's no need to write code to read and/or write the host files.
        One simple function call can be used to read all the data files and
        another single call can be used to write them all back out!

      * The programming interface to the PDK is compatible with HOST
        3.1x, HOST 3.2, PHOST 3.15.1.x, and PHOST 3.2.2.x. This means that
        your code will work with all 4 of the above host programs.

      * The PDK is portable to multiple hardware platforms; in fact, all of
        the platforms that are supported by PHOST are also supported by the
        PDK. The programming interface to the PDK stays the same regardless
        of what platform is used. This makes porting the add-on or utility
        a snap! Simply recompile on a new platform with the PDK for that
        platform.

      * The PDK keeps up with changes in the file formats so your code
        doesn't have to. When a new PDK is released, simply recompile with
        the latest version and your program is instantly compatible with
        the latest formats.

Best of all, the PDK is freeware (but not in the public domain). You can
use the PDK at no cost to write your programs. You can even sell your
programs if you wish; there are no royalties or other fees. You must,
however, observe the restrictions described in the file LEGAL.DOC that
comes with the PDK distribution.

What languages are supported?
=============================

The PDK was written in C. Thus, C and C++ programs may be written using the
PDK. Other languages may be used if they provide an interface to C-type
variable and function declarations but this has not been attempted.

For Win32 systems several PDK versions are available to support different
compilers. Currently we support BorlandC++ 5.0, Borland/Inprise CBuilder 4
and Cygwin GCC.

DOS is no longer supported.


How to get it?
==============

The latest version of the PDK distribution can be found at the PHOST
WWW site:

    http://www.nefo.med.uni-muenchen.de/~phost/phost3.html

The most recent version is 3.2.4.1 as of April 2, 2000.


What does the PDK *NOT* do?
===========================

The PDK is still being expanded and enhanced so there are some functions
that will be added as time goes by. Currently, though, the PDK is complete
enough to allow for serious application development.

It should be noted that the PDK provides no mechanisms for tampering with
the shareware/registered distinction in player turn files. That is, the PDK
cannot be used to write a utility that will make a shareware player appear
to be registered to the HOST/PHOST program.

How do I get started ?
======================

Read through the *.DOC files that come with this distribution. A suggested
reading order is:
             LEGAL.DOC
             INSTALL.DOC

Then, read through some of the example programs (EX*.C files). You may even
want to try compiling them, running them, and modifying them to "get your
hands dirty" with PDK programming. Once you have obtained a feel for how to
program with the PDK, browse through the API.DOC file for a complete
description of the PDK application programming interface (API).

What's with this long version number?
=====================================

The version information for the PDK has 4 components: the first 2 describe
the original HOST version which the PDK is compatible with (with respect to
file formats). For example, PDK version 3.2.X.XX means that this version is
intended to be compatible with HOST 3.2 and PHOST 3.2.2.x as well as prior
versions. The last 2 components describe the revision level of the PDK
itself. The third component is the major revision number and changes when
the latest revision of the PDK becomes incompatible with previous versions.
The last component is the minor revision number and changes with each new
release.

It is safe to simply replace an older version of the PDK with a newer
version when only the minor revision number changes. When a
backwards-incompatible version of the PDK is released, the major revision
number will be incremented. Upgrade instructions will be provided at this
time.


The Distribution Files
======================

Here is a description of the files that are included with all distributions
of the PDK (for all platforms):

     PDK.DOC         -- You're reading it
     LEGAL.DOC       -- Legal information for the PDK
     INSTALL.DOC     -- Guide to installing the PDK
     CHANGES.DOC     -- Revision history of the PDK
     API.DOC         -- The main documentation -- describes the application
                        programming interface (API) to the PDK
     PHOSTPDK.H      -- Header file for the PDK library
     EX1.C           -- PDK example program: counts the number of ships,
                        planets, and bases that a player has and reports
                        them in a player message
     EX2.C           -- PDK example program: alternative mine decay
                        algorithm reduces minefields so that the radius
                        changes by a constant amount every turn
     EX3.C           -- PDK example program: Micheal Keane's Invasion
                        program ported to use the PDK. Score points for
                        invading homeworlds and any other world the host
                        indicates.
     EX4.C           -- PDK example program: a simple replacement for
                        MASTER. No options, no scenarios, just an example
                        and possibly a template for bigger and better
                        things.
     EX5.C           -- PDK example program: an add-on example using the
                        AUXHOST facility of HOST/PHOST 3.2. This program
                        implements a simple base-to-base transporter that
                        is able to transfer cargo from one starbase to
                        another.
     EX6.C           -- PDK example program: a text-only battle simulator
                        with minimal functionality. It is mean to
                        demonstrate the interface to the PDK combat module.

The PDK is an offshoot of the PHOST program, which was programmed by
Andrew Sterian, Thomas Voigt, and Steffen Pietsch. Thanks are due to the
many many people who helped with the development of PHOST and to all those
who support and encourage the PHOST project. Thanks to Rick Rogers for
helping out with the Microsoft C port.
