PTSCORE v1.4


This will be very likely the last version since I don't work on my VGAP utils
anymore. I included the sources so that everybody can develop the program
further. Please note that the sources to PTSCORE are distributed under the
GNU general public license.



What's new in v1.4 ?
====================
v1.4 
- Sources are included (PDK based) 

v1.3c
- Option to include the original scores
- Support for names.dat file (see "Player names")




Aim
===
The internal VGA Planets score is not very accurate. A tiny scout
counts as much as a big carrier, and a planet with just one clan 
is as good as a planet with 300 mines and 200 factories.

PTSCORE will give you a score that counts your minerals, supplies,
megacredits and all ships/bases/planetary structures that you have built.
It is also able to give you a more detailed score (with details about
bases, warships, planets and freighters) but you can also remove all
information that you don't want to give to your players.
You can also calculate team scores.



Usage
=====
PTSCORE [options] [gamedirectory] [rootdirectory]

gamedirectory : This is the directory where the host data is located and
                where ptscore looks for the global data files first. Global
                data files are files that are not game-specific like the
                starmap (xyplan.dat), the shiplist and the planet names.
                The ptscore.log file is created in the game directory.

rootdirectory : This is the directory where ptscore looks for the global
                datafiles if it can't find them in the game directory.

Control options :
       -h  : print help
       -r  : don't append score to results
       -m  : mute operation (don't print the score to the screen)
       -f  : don't generate a ptscore.log file
       -t  : configure teams

Scoring options :
       -v  : votes mode (overrides all other scoring options)
       -T  : disable total score
       -U  : disable used score
       -R  : disable used/total relation
       -P  : enable planetary detailed score
       -B  : enable starbase detailed score
       -W  : enable warship detailed score
       -F  : enable freighter score
       -p  : enable planet count
       -b  : enable base count
       -w  : enable warship count
       -f  : enable freighter count
       -S? : sort score by [t]otal, [u]sed, [r]atio, [b]ases,
             [p]lanets, [w]arships, [f]reighters or [0] race number



Examples :

Assume the host data is in dir .\test .

PTSCORE test -mPBWFSw

will generate a score that contains all available scores except the total
score. The score is sorted by the warship score. Doesn't make much sense
because the total score can still be calculated by the percentage score,
but anyway ... :-)
The score will not appear on the screen.


PTSCORE -rSt

will show a score that is sorted by the total score on the screen.
The -r switch is necessary to prevent ptscore from writing the score to
the results.


PTSCORE -t

will prompt you for the team setup (the default is that no player belongs to
a team) and exit without generating a score. You should run PTSCORE -t once
before you use it for a team game.



Files
=====
In the game directory or in the root directory :
HULLSPEC.DAT  ENGSPEC.DAT  BEAMSPEC.DAT  TORPSPEC.DAT  TRUEHULL.DAT

In the game directory (with the host data files) you need :
BDATA.HST  PDATA.HST  SHIP.HST  MINES.HST   NEXTTURN.HST

If you want to use team scores and you configure the teams, ptscore
will create a 'TEAM.DAT' file in the game directory.




Player names
============

PTSCORE will look for a "names.dat" file in the host data subdirectory.
If the file is found then PTSCORE will consider the 11 first lines of this
file as the names of the players (race 1 .. race 11) and add these names
to the scoring info of these players in the ptscore.log file.

This way you can send out the name, email or whatever you consider of
importance along with the score file. Just create a plain text file called
"names.dat" in the host directory, put the text for player #1 in the first
line and so on. For players who are not active you must insert a blank
line. You can use up to 80 characters for this line, however, it is
recommended that you keep the lines as short as possible so that all
lines of ptscore.log are shorter than 80 characters (the size of a text
screen). The names are not added to the message inserted into the result
files. A sample names.dat file is included to this zip file.





Defaults 
========
The default parameters are
* sort by used score
* enable total & used score + ratio
* write directly to the results and generate PTSCORE.LOG file





Score calculation 
=================
Each kt minerals counts 3 points, each supply and megacredit counts one 
point. Each structure equals the score that was necessary to build it, 
except fighters which count 20 points each (thats the score for a fighter
that was built in space). Fuel counts nothing.
The space mine score depends on the torpedo score : ptscore will assume that
the player used the torp with the lowest possible (ptscore-)score.
The space mine score is added to the warship score (this is because torps
loaded onto ships count for the warship score and mine laying shouldn't
be obvious to the other players).


Don't be curious if you find differences between SCORE4a and PTSCORE.
SCORE4a 'forgets' the beams mounted on ships and all structures
which are currently in starbase storage (hulls, engines, beams, tubes).


If you select no command line parameters you will see the following
scores. You can blank any of them.

'total'   : This score column contains your overall score, counting
            all minerals, supplies, megacredits, ships, bases and
            planetary structures.

'used'    : You can use your minerals/credits to build ships. You can also
            let them rot on your planets, so they will do nothing.
            The 'used' score tells you how much of your score is 'used'
            (base score + planetary score + warship score + freighter score).

'%'       : The effectivity, rates your ability to use your resources.
            It is used_score*100/total_score and shows the percentage of
            your score that you used to build ships/bases/mines etc.


These scores are optional :

'bases'   : the score from base defense, base fighters and tech levels.
            Hulls and other structures in storage won't count because
            there is no practical use for them in combat.

'planets' : the score from mines, factories and defense.

'warships': the score used to build warships. It includes the ammunition
            (torps, fighters), but not the cargo of warships.
            The space mine score is added to this score.

'ships'   : the score from the freighters without the cargo.




Votes mode
==========
This mode uses Juha Pohjalainens algorithm from votes.exe to generate a score.
Every factory and every defense post is worth 1 point, and starbase tech levels
are worth the amount of money that was spent to upgrade the tech levels 
divided by 100 (so a tech level of 10 is worth 45 points).
Then 499 votes are split among the players according to their score.
