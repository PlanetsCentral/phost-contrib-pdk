                     THE PORTABLE HOST DEVELOPMENT KIT
                         Installation Instructions
                                Version 4.4


Getting The Source
-------------------

The PDK home page is at
  http://phost-contrib.sourceforge.net/
SourceForge's project description is at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/phost-contrib/

You can get an "official" source archive there, or fetch the
CVS version. In a nutshell (assuming bash, Linux):
 $ mkdir src; cd src
 $ cvs login
 // just hit Enter at the password prompt
 $ cvs co phostpdk
 $ cvs logout
 $ cd phostpdk


Compiling
----------

Right now, the PDK does not configure itself 100% automatically. It
comes with several makefiles (`makefile.XXX'), and you have to pick
one. There should be one that works for you. The best-tested one is
probably `makefile.gcc' which is for GNU make and gcc. Maybe the
easiest way to go is to copy it, modifying it if needed. `makefile.dj'
is for Borland make and DJGPP2 gcc.

Install the following files to a place where the compiler will find
them:
    * phostpdk.h, doscvt.h: the API include files
    * libpdk.a or pdk.lib: the library you'll be linking againgt

To compile your own PDK programs, #include <phostpdk.h> (and
<doscvt.h> if needed), and link against the library. For example,
assume you have installed the PDK in a subdirectory `phostpdk', so you
can do
    gcc -c module.c -Iphostpdk
to compile your modules, and
    gcc -o program module.o -Lphostpdk -lpdk


OLD INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

The installation of the PDK is very straightforward.

    * Simply place the PHOSTPDK.H file in a global or local include
      directory and place the PDK.LIB (or MSCPDK.LIB, or PDK32.LIB, or
      libpdk.a) file in a global or local library directory.

To use the PDK, you need only do the following:

    * Include the file <phostpdk.h> in your source files.

    * Link with the PDK.LIB (or MSCPDK.LIB, or PDK32.LIB, or libpdk.a)
      library.

That's it!

Platform-Specific Notes
=======================

* For the DOS distribution, your program must be compiled in the large model.

* For Win32 systems are several PDK versions available to support different
  compilers. Currently we support BorlandC++ 5.0, Borland/Inprise CBuilder 4
  and Cygwin GCC.
