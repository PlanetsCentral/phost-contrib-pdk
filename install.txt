                     THE PORTABLE HOST DEVELOPMENT KIT
                         Installation Instructions
                             Version 3.2.4.1

The installation of the PDK is very straightforward.

    * Simply place the PHOSTPDK.H file in a global or local include
      directory and place the PDK.LIB (or MSCPDK.LIB, or PDK32.LIB, or
      libpdk.a) file in a global or local library directory.

To use the PDK, you need only do the following:

    * Include the file <phostpdk.h> in your source files.

    * Link with the PDK.LIB (or MSCPDK.LIB, or PDK32.LIB, or libpdk.a)
      library.

That's it!

Platform-Specific Notes
=======================

* For the DOS distribution, your program must be compiled in the large model.

* For Win32 systems are several PDK versions available to support different
  compilers. Currently we support BorlandC++ 5.0, Borland/Inprise CBuilder 4
  and Cygwin GCC.
