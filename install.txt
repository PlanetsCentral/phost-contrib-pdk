                     THE PORTABLE HOST DEVELOPMENT KIT
                         Installation Instructions
                                Version 4.5


Getting The Source
-------------------

The PDK home page is at
  http://phost-contrib.sourceforge.net/
SourceForge's project description is at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/phost-contrib/

You can get an "official" source archive there, or fetch the
CVS version. In a nutshell (assuming bash, Linux):
    * mkdir src; cd src
    * cvs login
      No password required, just hit ENTER
    * cvs co phostpdk
    * cvs logout
    * cd phostpdk


Compiling
----------

Right now, the PDK does not configure itself 100% automatically. There
are two Makefiles:
    * "Makefile" is for GNU make and gcc, under various Unix-like
      operating systems:
         * DOS with DJGPP
         * Windows with Cygwin
         * Linux
         * BeOS
         * probably many others
    * "Makefile.bor" is for Borland Make and Borland C++ 5.5, the
      free command line compiler from Borland.

To build the PDK for your platform, pick (and customize) the right
Makefile, and then just invoke "make" to build it. If you have some
customisations to be made, please prefer changing an existing Makefile
(i.e. by adding an if/else/endif block) instead of creating a new
Makefile.

The build result will be a file "libpdk.a" or "pdk.lib", as well as
executable files for the utilities (sendmess, pmaster, etc.)


Using
-----

You do not need to formally install the PDK. You can compile and link
PDK programs by telling your C compiler to look for headers and
libraries in the PDK directory:

    gcc -c module.c -I/path/to/phostpdk
    gcc -o program module.o -L/path/to/phostpdk -lpdk

If you wish to install it:

    * copy "libpdk.a" or "pdk.lib" into your "libraries" directory
      (e.g. /usr/lib, %PROGRAMFILES%\bcc55\Lib) copy
    * "phostpdk.h", "version.h" and "doscvt.h" into your "include"
      directory (e.g. /usr/include, %PROGRAMFILES%\bcc55\Include).

Note that the "version.h" file defines some compile-time options. It
will affect the way how the PDK library accesses the configuration
structure, for example. If you want to change some of these options,
you must recompile the PDK.
