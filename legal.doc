The software library included with this distribution may be linked with

all files present, including this file. The software and documentation may
be modified for personal use but no modified files may be distributed under
any circumstances, except for the example program files (with filenames
ex*.c) which may be modified and distributed as long as all modifications
are clearly documented and marked with the name of the person who made the
modifications along with the modification date. All copies of the software
and documentation must be distributed at no cost, monetary or otherwise,
except for a reasonable fee to cover the cost of physical media (if the
copies are distributed on physical media) which may not exceed US$3.00
(three US dollars) in value (at current exchange rates, if applicable) per
copy.
